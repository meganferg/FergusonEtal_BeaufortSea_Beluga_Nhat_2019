# 1. From Citta et al. 2013. Dive behavior of Eastern Chukchi 
#    beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), 1998-2008:
#    *[p. 402] Dive Duration
#      In general, belugas dove 5.1 - 9.8 times per hour. Fewer 
#      dives occurred during periods when belugas were diving to 
#      deeper depths (Table 5). The average duration of dives was 
#      very consistent across dive types (i.e., shallow, 
#      intermediate, and deep), although the longest dives (> 21 
#      min) were observed during periods with the deepest dives.
#
#      Average dive duration ranged from 3.4 to 5.1 min (Table 5). 
#      After accounting for region, we found no significant relationship
#      between sex or age and average or maximum dive durations. 
#      While there were some significant interactions between 
#      region and age, the effects on dive duration were slight. 
#      For example, although average duration had a significant 
#      interaction with region*age, it varied by less than a minute
#      within regions (Fig. 8a). In general, average dive duration 
#      was fairly consistent across regions, sexes, and ages (Fig. 
#      8a), while the maximum dive duration increased as depth 
#      increased (Fig. 8b).
#
#      Our findings generally agree with other studies of beluga 
#      dive behavior. Kingsley et al. (2001) found that most dives 
#      were shorter than 10 min in duration and that dive duration 
#      did not vary greatly with dive depth in Hudson Bay, where 
#      depth ranged from 40 to 400 m. Near Somerset Island, Canada,
#      Martin and Smith (1999) observed a longer mean dive time 
#      (13.1 min) than we observed, but a similar maximum dive 
#      duration (22.9 min). For beluga whales near Devon Island, 
#      Canada, Heide-J?rgenson et al. (1998) found that most dives
#      ranged from 9 to 18 min, which is also similar to the
#      durations we observed (Table 5).

#    ring seals in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Arctic 14, 162â€“175.

#    beluga whale population estimates. Working paper for Alaska Beluga Whale

# 3. Estimate of time in view (tiv) for belugas for ASAMM surveys
#    on the Cmdr and Otter were computed as
#          tiv = div/speed
#    where div = distance in view. Because the estimated field of 
#    view for both the Cmdr and Otter is greater than the 
#    right-truncation distance for this analysis (Cmdr max.w.Dl=1.140511; Otter 
#    max.w.Dl=1.095209), use the max.w.Dl to inform div. --> div = 1.1 km
